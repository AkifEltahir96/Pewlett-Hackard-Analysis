# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to further prepare for the "silver tsunami" as Pewlett Hackard employees are reaching retirement age. In addition to the previous analysis, here I will determine the amount of employees retiring per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results 

Here, I will list four major points from the two analyses I completed:
1. The positions that will be hit the hardest by the "silver tsunami" are senior engineer and senior staff. Over 28000 employees will be eligible for retirement. ! [Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png] (path/Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png). 
2. Some positions that will not be hit as hard by the "silver tsunami" are the manager and assistant engineer. ! [Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png] (path/Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png).
3. There will be over 400 eligible mentors for the senior staff and engineer positions. ! [Mentor-Eligibility-Numbers.png] (path/Mentor-Eligibility-Numbers.png).
4. A point of concern is that we currently have 2 soon-to-be retiring managers ! [Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png] (path/Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png) and no mentorship eligible managers on the current staff ! [Mentor-Eligibility-Numbers.png] (path/Mentor-Eligibility-Numbers.png).

## Summary 
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
In the four most recent hiring years (1997-2000) 12351 employees (around 3,090 per year) were hired by Pewlett-Hackard. However, in 4 years, 90398 Pewlett Hackard Employees are eligible to retire ! [Future-Hiring.png] (path/Future-Hiring.png) . While it is highly unlikely that every single retirement-eligible employee will retire, the personnel gap between new hires and retirement-eligible employees cannot be ignored. At the current hiring rate, Pewlett-Hackard will not be able to handle the impact as the "silver tsunami" begins to take an effect on the workforce. I suggest they try to double their current hiring rate over the next 4 years to prepare for the upcoming retirements. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Each department has over 3750 employees that are retirement-ready and eligible to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees ! [Department-Mentor-Eligibility.png] (path/Department-Mentor-Eligibility.png). The Development, Production and Sales departments have an abundance of eligible mentors (over 10000), while other departments such as Human Resources and Finance have lots of eligible mentors but less than half of the supply (less than 4000) of the previously mentioned departments.
