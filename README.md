# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to further prepare for the "silver tsunami" as Pewlett Hackard employees are reaching retirement age. In addition to the previous analysis, here I will determine the amount of employees retiring per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results (do we complete this section based on any additional queries or no?)

Here, I will list four major points from the two analyses I completed:
1. The positions that will be hit the hardest by the "silver tsunami" are senior engineer and senior staff. Over 28000 employees will be eligible for retirement. ! [Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png] (path/Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png). 
2. Some positions that will not be hit as hard by the "silver tsunami" are the manager and assistant engineer. ! [Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png] (path/Retirement Numbers by Job Title.png).
3. There will be over 400 eligible mentors for the senior staff and engineer positions. [picture citation].
4. A point of concern is that we currently have 2 soon-to-be retiring managers and no mentorship eligible managers on the current staff. [picture citation] 


## Summary 
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? (unsure of this question?)

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? (slightly unsure of this question)?
